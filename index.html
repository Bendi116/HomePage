                            <p>Shoulder Pressing Pose is an intermediate arm balance whereupon the legs are wrapped
                                outside the shoulders and ankles are crossed at the front. The Sanskrit name reflects
                                the pressing motion applied to the shoulders (“Bhuja” meaning arm or shoulder, “pida”
                                meaning pressure).</p>

                                Lotus in Shoulder Stand Pose, or Padma Sarvangasana, is an advanced inversion pose which
                                offers stretching as well as strengthening benefits. Primarily, it strengthens and
                                stabilizes the back and the core as their work is needed to maintain the balance in the
                                pose – hence the abs are also getting toned. At the same time, the Lotus in Shoulder
                                Stand Pose opens the shoulders, the arms and the hips, increasing one’s flexibility.
                                Being a typical Vata and Third Eye Chakra stimulating pose, it clears the mind and
                                boosts imagination.

                                twist and a subsequent shift of centre of gravity. While Crow Pose can be considered a
                                fairly accessible arm balance, Side Crow takes it to a different level and requires a
                                lot more skill and coordination.</p>

                            <p>Handstand Pose, or Adho Mukha Vrksasana, is an advanced inversion pose yet it is one of
                                the most core strengthening yoga poses there exists. It engages multiple abdominal
                                muscles including the transverse and oblique muscles as well as rectus abdominis, same
                                for many upper body muscles like trapezius, triceps and the deltoids. Without doubt, it
                                improves one’s balance and focus. Furthermore, it is indeed energizing and calming at
                                the same time as it healthily adjusts the breathing pattern.</p>

                                opens the chest, and stretches the muscles of the groin, shoulders, and arms. It is also
                                a great pose to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety.</p>

                            <p>Peacock pose, or Mayurasana, is the type of pose that relies on hand-balancing. It is
                                mostly associated with Hatha yoga; however, you may encounter this pose in other types
                                of yoga. If you are into flying and balance, this pose is the right fit for you. It will
                                strengthen your arm and forearm muscles, carve your abdominal muscles, and power-up your
                                lower body. In short, this pose is the closest thing to flying as a human! Do not get
                                too excited though, this pose is for advanced yogis and should be performed gradually.

                            <p>Lord of the Dance Pose, or Natarajasana – also known as Dancer Pose – is a typical Vata
                                stimulating pose which means it makes it easier for us to gather and organize thoughts
                                and express them creatively in a desired manner. Our mind becomes clear and our
                                imagination unleashed. The Lord of the Dance Pose also possesses physical benefits,
                                namely it increases the flexibility of the spine, extends the chest as well as stretches
                                the leg muscles like the psoas, the hamstrings and the quadriceps. Letting more air into
                                the lungs, it encourages healthy breathing patterns.

                            <p>Dove Pose, or Vajra Kapotasana, is a floor pose which is a powerful test of flexibility.
                                This is a pose that should be worked up to with gentler backbend shapes. It’s important
                                to practice with Pigeon Pose before attempting Dove Pose. It’s also a good idea to have
                                a helper on hand as you first go through test runs of achieving this. The name comes
                                from the shape of a fluffed up bird.
